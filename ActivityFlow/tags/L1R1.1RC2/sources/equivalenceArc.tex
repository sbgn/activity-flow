\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Equivalence arc} }\label{sec:equivalenceArc}

\glyph{Equivalence Arc} is the arc used to represent the fact that all activities or compartments
marked by a \glyph{tag} are equivalent.  Since each AN can only appear once in a compartment, this arc is not going to be used in any main \AFm.  It is useful, however, to show that an AN in a submap and another AN in the main map are equivalent.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm Not applicable.
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{Activity node} (\sect{af:ANs}) or any \glyph{compartment}.
 \glyphTarget \glyph{Tag}.
 \glyphEndPoint No particular symbol is used to represent the end of an \glyph{equivalence arc}.
 \end{glyphDescription}
