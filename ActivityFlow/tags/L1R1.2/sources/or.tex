\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Or}}
\label{sec:af:or}

The glyph \glyph{or} is used to denote that any of the \glyph{ANs} linked as input is sufficient to influence the target activity.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000174 ! or.
 \glyphOrigin More than one \glyph{biological activity} (\sect{af:biologicalActivity}) and \glyph{logical arcs} (~\sect{af:logicArc}).
 \glyphTarget  \glyph{Modulation arc} (\sect{af:arcs}) other than \glyph{equivalence arc}.
 \glyphNode \glyph{Or} is represented by a circle carrying the word ``OR'', with two connectors located at the opposite side for inputs and output.
 \end{glyphDescription}
