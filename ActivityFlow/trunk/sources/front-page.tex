% The title page is considered unnumbered and the next page after this
% starts with the page number 1 (actually, i), but the duplication of page
% number 1 confuses hyperref and leads to the following latex warning:
%
%   "pdfTeX warning (ext4): destination with the same identifier
%   (name{page.1}) has been already used, duplicate ignored"
%
% The following change makes the title page have page number 1 and the next
% page after that it becomes page ii.  This is unorthodox, but seems not
% completely unreasonable, and it avoids the confusing warning above.
