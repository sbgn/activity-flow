\chapter{Activity Flow Diagram glyphs}

%[Note on the color code: \textcolor{blue}{The glyphs that have been thorougly discussed, and are considered frozen, are represented in blue}. \textcolor{green}{The glyphs that have been thorougly discussed, but are still posing problems are represented in green}. \textcolor{red}{The glyphs that have been proposed but for which in-depth discussion is yet to come are represented in red}.]

This chapter provides a catalog of the graphical symbols available for representing entities in \AFs. In \chap{af:grammar} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:af:grammar}, we describe the rules for combining these glyphs into a legal SBGN \AF, and in \chap{af:layout} beginning on page~\pageref{chp:af:layout}, we describe requirements and guidelines for the way that diagrams are visually organized.

\section{Activity nodes}\label{af:sec:ANs}

An activity node (AN) represents the activity of an entity or an entity pool, but not the entities themselves. For instance, multiple activity nodes can be used to represent different activities of a particular entity, while one activity node can be used to represent the activity of a complex multimer.

\SBGNAFLone uses one glyph to represent activities from all biological entities, collectively called \emph{biological activity}. The nature of the molecule that the activity comes from can be encoded in the \emph{units of information} (\sect{af:unitInfo}).  Activities of specific types of macromolecules, such as protein, RNA, DNA, polysaccharide, and specific simple chemicals are not defined by \SBGNAFLone but may be part of future levels of SBGN. In addition to activities of material entities, \SBGNAFLone represents activity from two conceptual entities: \emph{perturbation}, \emph{observable}.  Auxiliary units such as units of information, state variables are not shown on the activity nodes.  Each activity is displayed only once in one compartment.

\section{Container nodes}
\label{sec:af:CNs}

\glyph{Containers} are SBGN constructions that contain one or several other SBGN constructs.  There are two container nodes in \SBGNAFLone: \glyph{compartment} and \glyph{submap}.
