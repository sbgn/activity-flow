\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{And}}
\label{sec:af:and}

The output of an \glyph{and} glyph is True if all its inputs are True, and False otherwise.  


\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000173 ! and.
 \glyphIncoming One or more \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{af:logicArc}).
 \glyphOutgoing  One \glyph{logic arc} (\sect{af:logicArc}) or one of the influence arcs (\sect{af:arcs}).
 \glyphContainer An \glyph{and} operator is represented by a circular shape containing the word ``AND''.
The shape is linked to two ports, that are small arcs attached to the centres of opposite sides of the shape, as shown in \fig{af:and}.
 \glyphLabel None.
 \glyphAux None.
