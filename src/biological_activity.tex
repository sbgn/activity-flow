\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Biological activity}}
\label{sec:af:biologicalActivity}

\SBGNAFLone uses one glyph to represent molecular activities of all types of biological entities, collectively they are called \emph{biological activity}. The nature of the molecule that the activity comes from, e.g., simple chemical or macromolecule, can be encoded in the \emph{units of information} (\sect{af:unitInfo}).

It should be noted that the \emph{biological activity} is not equivalent to a biological entity per se.  A biological activity can come from one biological entity, a part of an entity, or a combination of  them.  It is up to the users to determine how to represent it in their diagram.  For example, a protein kinase receptor such as an EGF receptor, has two activities, the binding activity that allows the extracellular part of the receptor to bind to the ligand, and the kinase activity that is capable of phosphorylating the downstream protein and initiating the intracellular signalling.  The user can choose to use two nodes to represent each activity, or to use one node to represent the overall "EGF receptor activity" (\fig{af:EGFR}).  More examples can be found in examples in Appendix \ref{af:example}.

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm SBO:0000412 ! biological activity

\glyphIncoming Zero or more \glyph{influence} arcs (\sect{af:arcs}).

\glyphOutgoing Zero or more \glyph{influence} arcs (\sect{af:arcs}), \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{af:logicArc}), or \glyph{equivalence arcs} (\sect{equivalenceArc}).

\glyphContainer A \glyph{biological activity} is represented by a rectangle, as shown in \fig{af:biologicalActivity}.

\glyphLabel A \glyph{biological activity} is identified by a label placed in an unbordered box containing a string of characters.  The characters can be distributed on several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory.  The label box must be attached to the centre of the container.  The label may spill outside of the container.

\glyphAux A \glyph{biological activity} can carry a \glyph{unit of information} (\sect{af:unitInfo}), which can provide information such as the nature of the entity from which the activity originated.  Specific glyphs are used to represent different types of entities (\sect{af:unitInfo}).  The centre of the bounding box of a \glyph{unit of information} must lie on the border of the \glyph{biological activity} node.  The label in the \glyph{unit of information}, which is optional, indicates the name of the molecule where the activity comes from, as shown in \fig{af:EGFR}.

  \caption{An example of \AF glyphs of EGFR activities.  Since EGFR protein has both binding and kinase activities, each of those activities can be represented by different nodes, labelled as \emph{EGFR binding} and \emph{EGFR kinase}.  One node can be used to represent the overall activity of \emph{EGFR}.  The label in the \glyph{unit of information} indicates the protein that the activities come from.  In this example, all three activities come from the same EGFR protein.}
