The following diagrams present examples of SBGN Activity Flow diagrams representing biological activities and their influences among each other in pathway networks.  They by no means exhaust the possibilities of \SBGNAFLone.

\fig{TGF} presents an example of a signalling pathway involving the regulation of TGF$\beta$-induced metastasis.  The pathway was described in a report titled "A Mutant-p53/Smad Complex Opposes p63 to Empower TGF$\beta$-Induced Metastasis" in the 2009 April issue of Cell~\cite{Adorno:2009}.  The figure shows the usage of \glyph{biological activity nodes}, \glyph{phenotype}, \glyph{positive influence} arc, \glyph{negative influence} arc, \glyph{necessary stimulation} arc, and \glyph{logic operator}.

\fig{EGF} presents a more complicated example of signalling pathway involving the intracellular signalling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  This example is a redraw of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Pathway described in the Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment (\url{https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/resource.2375846/full/stke-1714066887583.pdf}).

\fig{TGFbeta} shows the transforming growth factor beta (TGF$\beta$) signalling pathway.  The map is a redraw of the TRG-beta Signaling Pathway described in the PANTHER Pathway System (\url{http://www.pantherdb.org/pathway/pathwayDiagram.jsp?catAccession=P00052}) and is based on reviews by Massague~\cite{Massague:1998} and Derynck~\cite{Derynck:2001}.

\fig{AP} presents the simplest view of action potential propagation mediated by the voltage-gated sodium channels.  There are two views of how voltage-gated ion channels are involved.  The diagram on the left side shows that the \glyph{increase in membrane potential} activates \glyph{voltage-gated sodium channel activity}, which in turn triggers membrane \glyph{depolarisation}.  The membrane depolarisation activates \glyph{voltage-gated potassium channel} activity, which results in repolarising the membrane potential. The diagram on the right side provides more detail in the mechanism.  It shows that the \glyph{increase in membrane potential} first activates the \glyph{gating activity} of the channel, which in turn activates the \glyph{conductance activity} leading to the membrane \glyph{depolarisation}.  In this case, both \glyph{gating activity} and \glyph{conductance activity} come from the sodium channel, which is indicated as the \glyph{unit of information}.  In addition, this example also shows the advantage of using Activity Flow maps, because certain activities, such as gating and conductance, come from a few amino acids in particular three-dimensional structures that are not able to be illustrated in either Process Description or Entity Relationship maps.
