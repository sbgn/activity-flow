\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Or}}
\label{sec:af:or}

The output of an \glyph{or} glyph is True if at least one of its inputs is True, and False otherwise.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000174 ! or.
 \glyphIncoming One or more \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{af:logicArc}).
 \glyphOutgoing  One \glyph{logic arc} (\sect{af:logicArc}) or one of the influence arcs (\sect{af:arcs}).
 \glyphContainer An \glyph{or} operator is represented by a circular shape containing the word ``OR''.
The shape is linked to two ports, that are small arcs attached to the centres of opposite sides of the shape, as shown in \fig{af:or}.
 \glyphLabel None.
 \glyphAux None.
