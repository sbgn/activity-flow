\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Or}}
\label{sec:af:or}

The glyph \glyph{or} is used to denote that any of the \glyph{ANs} linked as input is sufficient to influence the target activity.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000174 ! or.
 \glyphIncoming One or more \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{af:logicArc}).
 \glyphOutgoing  One \glyph{logic arc} (\sect{af:logicArc}) or one of the modulation arcs (\sect{af:arcs}).
 \glyphContainer An \glyph{or} operator is represented by a circular shape containing the word ``OR''.
The shape is linked to two ports, that are small arcs attached to the centres of opposite sides of the shape, as shown in \fig{af:or}.
The incoming \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{af:logicArc}) are linked to the extremity of the leftmost or uppermost port, while the outgoing \glyph{logic arc} (\sect{af:logicArc}) or modulation arc (\sect{af:arcs}) is linked to the extremity of the rightmost or bottommost port.
 \glyphLabel None.
 \glyphAux None.
