\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Phenotype}}
\label{sec:af:phenotype}

A phenotype is a type of biological process.  In SBGN, \emph{phenotype} is used to show the observable or measurable outcome of the network.  It is usually the end-point(s) of the network, i.e., it can not be used as the start of an arc.

\glyphContainer A \glyph{phenotype} is represented by an elongated hexagon, as illustrated in \fig{af:phenotype}.

\glyphLabel An \glyph{phenotype} is identified by a label placed in an unbordered box containing a string of characters.  The characters can be distributed on several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory.  The label box must be attached to the center of the \glyph{phenotype} container.  The label may spill outside of the container.
